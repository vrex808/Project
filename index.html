  <p class="intro">I am a newly wed and also a newbie when it comes to coding.</p>
  
  <h2>A little something about me:</h2>

  <p>I was born in Honolulu, HI. We nearly immediately moved to Minneapolis, MN and lived there til I was four years old. 
    My mom's side of the family had moved to WA so we then moved to Bellevue. I grew up in Redmond my whole life.  
    I graduated from Redmond High School in 2008. 
    I wanted to be a pharmacist, but things had gotten in my way to which I did not have the mental and emotional capacity to proceed. 
    I ended up choosing another career path and became a licensed Hearing Instrument Specialist. 
    I have been married for eight months now, but have been in a relationship with my wife for seven years. 
    She is my <strong>everything!</strong>
    I earned that degree from Spokane Falls Community College. 
    Currently, I am working at the Costco Hearing Aid Center in Lynnwood. 
    This will be my third year there. 
    I followed my late father's footsteops into this career path. 
    My associate has a partner who had attended Epicodus, which is how I became interested in a second career path.</p>

  <p>So far at Epicodus, I have learn so much about the coding languages. 
    I took it upon myself to <em>Learn Python the Hard Way</em>, which is a book by Zed A. Shaw that I started reading as an introduction to what I was getting myself into. 
    I am having a lot of fun with this course and would love to start a new life within this career!</p>
