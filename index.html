  <p class="intro">I am a newly wed and also a newbie when it comes to coding.</p>
  
  <h2>A little something about me:</h2>

  <p class="author">I was born in Honolulu, HI. I am a first generation Laotian/American. We immediately moved to Minneapolis, MN and lived there til I was four years old. 
    My mom's side of the family had moved to WA, so we then moved to Bellevue. I grew up in Redmond my whole life.  
    I graduated from Redmond High School in 2008. 
    I wanted to be a pharmacist, but things had gotten in my way to which I did not have the mental/emotional capacity to proceed. 
    I ended up choosing another career path and became a licensed Hearing Instrument Specialist. 
    I earned that degree from Spokane Falls Community College which only took two years.
    I have been married for eight months now, but have been in a relationship with my wife for seven years. 
    She is my <strong>everything!</strong>
    Currently, I am working at the Costco Hearing Aid Center in Lynnwood. 
    This will be my third year there. 
    I followed my late father's footsteops into this career path. 
    One of my co-workers has a partner who had attended Epicodus, which is how I became interested in this second career path.</p>

  <p>So far at Epicodus, I have learn so much about the coding languages. 
    Prior to attending Epicodus, I took it upon myself to <em>Learn Python the Hard Way</em>, which is a book by Zed A. Shaw that I started reading as an introduction to what I was getting myself into. 
    I am having a lot of fun with this course and would love to start a new life within this career! 
    My current dev-team have been great!</p>

  <h3>Brief description of my projects at Epicodus using <span class="highlight">HTML</span> and <span class="highlight">CSS</span>:</h3>
  <ol class="list">
    <li><strong>Hello-world:</strong> My very first project, I learned about block elements, how to create an <span class="highlight">HTML</span> directory, and write in <span class="language">html</span> language.</li>
    <li><strong>Goodbye:</strong> I better learned how to create a github repository as well as write in <span class="highlight">HTML</span> using proper indentation along the way.</li>
    <li><strong>Cookie-recipe:</strong> I better understood the layout of <span class="highlight">HTML</span> using unordered lists and ordered lists.</li>
    <li><strong>Pets:</strong> This was something I got the chance to finally try out what I learned and be creative, showcasing my pets while using <span class="highlight">HTML</span>. Although I was having a hard time adding an image, I finally got it right!</li>
    <li><strong>My-first-webpage:</strong> For this project, I finally understood how to commit my work to my github repository. This is where I learned the flow. I also learned about styling <span class="highlight">HTML</span> using <span class="highlight">CSS</span>.</li>
    <li><strong>Paragraphs:</strong> I learned about styling with classes. I used <span class="highlight">HTML</span> and <span class="highlight">CSS</span>.</li>
    <li><strong>Cupcakes:</strong> This was my first collaboration project with my pair where I got to drive using <span class="highlight">HTML</span> and <span class="highlight">CSS</span>. We learned more about cloning and forking on our github repository.</li>
    <li><strong>JerkyBiz:</strong> I wanted to create my own company selling Laotian beef Jerky so I will be getting my website for it set up by the time I am finished with Epicodus. So far I have learned about divs, spans, floats, box models for <span class="highlight">CSS</span>.</li>
